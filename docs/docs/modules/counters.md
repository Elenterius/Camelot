# Counters Module
The counters module (id: `counters`, configuration class: `Counters`) provides users the ability to increment counters (integers) in chat:
- `<counter>++`: increments a counter by 1
- `<counter>--`: decrements a counter by 1
- `<counter>==`: gets a counter's value

For instance, `derps++` increments the value of the `derps` counter by 1.

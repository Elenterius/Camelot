# Camelot
Camelot is a self-hosted Discord bot with various features such as tricks (custom commands), moderation commands,
file Gist creation, quotes, counters etc.  
This bot is maintained and used by [NeoForged](https://neoforged.net), the Minecraft mod loader and is developed primarily for
Minecraft-related servers. It also serves as a replacement for [K9](https://www.tterrag.com/k9/), without mappings.

Setup documentation and other information can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/neoforged/Camelot/wiki).
